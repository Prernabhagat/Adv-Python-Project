# Adv-Python-Project

This is data cleaning project on a csv data file named imdb.csv
In this project I have used advance python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaburn
Firslty I have explored and cleaned the data to ensure that it is accurate and complete. This involved checking for missing values, duplicate data, and outliers.
My goal of analysis is to help the movie producer make informed decisions about his business. By providing him with valuable insights and recommendations.
